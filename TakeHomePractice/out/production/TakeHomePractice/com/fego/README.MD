Write a piece of code that,

// step 1Creates an ArrayList of String objects.
// step 2 Add 11 names of your choice to the list (first name followed be last name).
// step 3 Display the longest name in the list.
// step 4 Display the count of names that are more than 10 characters in length.
// step 5 Display the index of the first name that ends with an ’n’. If no name ends with an ’n’, display no name ends with character 'n'.
// step 6 Display all names that begin with a specific letter. The list and the letter should be passed as parameters to the method that displays these names.
// step 7 Create another list, shortNames, with all names from your list that are less than 8 characters in length.
// step 8 Sort your list in alphabetic order. Note that the String class contains compareTo(String) that orders the calling object and parameter object in alphabetic order.
